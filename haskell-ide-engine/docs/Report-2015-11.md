## Haskell IDE Engine progress report November 2015

Welcome Haskell IDE Engine (future) users,

Haskell IDE Engine progress report for November 2015.

### What is Haskell IDE Engine?

Not an IDE.

It is a common point to join together the effort of integrating tools into an IDE and the effort of writing tools for an IDE, by providing an API in the middle that each of these parties can work from and to.

### Important developments

The first commit to this project took place on 22 October.  In a little over a month we have had 290 commits, 116 PRs, and 114 issues.

We have 14 contributors, 16 forks, 155 stars and 36 watchers.

So it is safe to say we are actively working on the project.

At this point we have an initial implementation of the architecture, which allows for different front end transport implementations to interface with the IDE. The current supported transports are JSON over stdio and JSON over HTTP. The architecture allows for other data encodings or interface protocols, so long as the `hie` side can read and write to `TChan`s.

We have a `PluginDescriptor` type which captures information about a given plugin, which is loaded into the main dispatcher in a namespace per plugin.  The commands exposed by a plugin can run in synchronous or async mode, if they are long running, or must coordinate with backend infrastructure.

The initial plugins under development provide access to

* ghc-mod
* HaRe
* base plugin, allowing plugin introspection
* example plugin

A ghci-ng plugin is on hold pending the Remote GHCi work Simon Marlow is doing.

We have initial integrations to emacs, and to leksah.

### Current project focus

The current project focus is on getting our collective heads straight on what actually needs to be done, and to provide working integrations to at least 2 IDEs to get a better feel for what is needed.

Both of these are well in hand, and if anyone would like to join in the discussion happens via the github issue tracker and docs section of the project, as well as IRC at #haskell-ide-engine on freenode.
