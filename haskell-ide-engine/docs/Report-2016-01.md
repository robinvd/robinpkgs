Welcome Haskell IDE Engine users,

## Haskell IDE Engine progress report for January 2016.

### What is Haskell IDE Engine?

Not an IDE.

It is a common point for people in the Haskell community to pool their efforts
with respect to tooling.

For tool writers, provide tools as a HIE plugin, so it can be available on
supported IDEs

For IDE developers, integrate to HIE, and all the Haskell tools supported as
plugins become available

For users, it means the overall Haskell experience should improve.

### Important developments

A new ghc-dump-tree plugin based on https://github.com/edsko/ghc-dump-tree

### Current project focus

The current focus is to get the initial version working well enough for an alpha
release. To this end, there are some hardy developers using it in their daily
work in emacs.
