```
Off the top of my head, ordered approximately by importance:

    on-the-fly typechecking
    autocompletion
    documentation and type lookup; types also for compound expressions
    semi-automatic management of imports, dependencies and LANGUAGE pragmas
    auto-formatting
    jump-to-definition
    syntax highlighting that's actually correct and complete
    HLint-style suggestions
    profiling, testing and benchmarking integration

Many of these features are already covered by existing tools, but either with unsatisfactory
performance or not particularly well integrated. (No offense intended; I imagine that writing
Haskell tooling is exceptionally hard.)

If a majority of these features became a reality, that'd make me very happy indeed. Good luck
to you venerable fighters for a better Haskell experience.
